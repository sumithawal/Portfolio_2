      <description>A Portuguese Bank wants to market one of its products, Term deposit. These are generally short-term with maturities ranging anywhere from a month to a few years. Term deposits are an extremely safe investment and are therefore very appealing to conservative, low-risk investors. Instead of mass marketing, the bank has opted to be more proactive in identifying potential buyers and contacting the customer directly. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would subscribe or not.</description>

      <description>To design a detection and diagnosis of brain tumor from MRI is crucial to decrease the rate of casualties. Brain tumor is difficult to cure, because the brain has a very complex structure and the tissues are interconnected with each other in a complicated manner. Despite many existing approaches, robust and efficient segmentation of brain tumor is still an important and challenging task. Tumor segmentation and classification is a challenging task, because tumors vary in shape, appearance and location.</description>

      <description>Cardiovascular disease diagnosis is the most difficult task in medicine. The diagnosis of heart disease is complicated because it requires the grouping of massive volumes of clinical and pathological data. As a result of this dilemma, researchers and clinical professionals have developed a strong interest in the efficient and exact prediction of heart disease. When it comes to heart disease, it is critical to obtain an accurate diagnosis at an early stage because time is of the essence.</description>

      <description>The objective of our project is to be able to predict the price of a used car given various attributes (data) of that car. There is a saying that a car loses 10% of its value the moment you drive it off a lot. Given, that I would expect that one of the main predictors is the amount of miles driven in the car, since more driving wears down the car.</description>
